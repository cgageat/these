	abstract = {We consider the calculation of the surface tension from simulations of several models of water, such as the traditional TIP3P, SPC, SPC/E, and TIP4P models, and the new generation of TIP4P-like models including the TIP4P/Ew, TIP4P/Ice, and TIP4P/2005. We employ a thermodynamic route proposed by Gloor et al. [J. Chem. Phys.123, 134703 (2005)] to determine the surface tension that involves the estimate of the change in free energy associated with a small change in the interfacial area at constant volume. The values of the surface tension computed from this test-area method are found to be fully consistent with those obtained from the standard mechanical route, which is based on the evaluation of the components of the pressuretensor. We find that most models do not reproduce quantitatively the experimental values of the surface tension of water. The best description of the surface tension is given by those models that provide a better description of the vapor-liquid coexistence curve. The values of the surface tension for the SPC/E and TIP4P/Ew models are found to be in reasonably good agreement with the experimental values. From the present investigation, we conclude that the TIP4P/2005 model is able to accurately describe the surface tension of water over the whole range of temperatures from the triple point to the critical temperature. We also conclude that the test area is an appropriate methodological choice for the calculation of the surface tension not only for simple fluids, but also for complex molecular polar fluids, as is the case of water.},

Phys. 1992, 97, 5653) is generalized to treat particles with arbitrary electric multipole moments. Explicit development of the mean-field approximation is given for the case of mobile dipoles and monopoles (ions) surrounding an arbitrary collection of fixed charges embedded in macroions. In particular, a modified Poisson?Boltzmann (PB) equation is derived in which the mobile dipoles provide an effective spatially dependent dielectric constant. This equation implies a self-consistent iteration procedure by which the monopole and dipole densities are simultaneously determined in terms of single scalar (PB) field. Moreover, this equation can be derived from a minimum principle; an annealing strategy for computing the PB field is thereby suggested. In addition, explicit mean-field expressions for thermodynamic free energies are obtained as simple functionals of the PB field. Connection to the well-known Langevin dipole model is made. A numerical application to a system consisting of two parallel plates is presented in order to illustrate the utility of the formulation.},

This implicit solvent method allows for the determination of structural, orientational, and energetic solvation properties that are on a par with all-atom molecular simulations performed for the same system, while reducing the computer time by two orders of magnitude. This is illustrated by the study of an atomistically-resolved clay surface composed of over a thousand atoms wetted by a molecular dipolar solvent. The high numerical efficiency of the method is exploited to carry a systematic analysis of the electrostatic and non-electrostatic components of the surface-solvent interaction within the popular Clay Force Field (CLAYFF). Solvent energetics and structure are found to depend weakly upon the atomic charges distribution of the clay surface, even for a rather polar solvent. We conclude on the consequences of such findings for force-field development.},

	abstract = {Molecular Theory of Solvation presents the recent progress in the statistical mechanics of molecular liquids applied to the most intriguing problems in chemistry today, including chemical reactions, conformational stability of biomolecules, ion hydration, and electrode-solution interface. The continuum model of "solvation" has played a dominant role in describing chemical processes in solution during the last century. This book discards and replaces it completely with molecular theory taking proper account of chemical specificity of solvent. The main machinery employed here is the reference-interaction-site-model (RISM) theory, which is combined with other tools in theoretical chemistry and physics: the ab initio and density functional theories in quantum chemistry, the generalized Langevin theory, and the molecular simulation techniques. This book will be of benefit to graduate students and industrial scientists who are struggling to find a better way of accounting and/or predicting "solvation" properties.},

The method requires just the structure of protein and the potential energy parameters for the biomolecules and solutions as inputs. The calculation is carried out in two steps. The first step is to obtain the pair correlation functions for solutions consisting of water and ligands based on the RISM theory. Then, given the pair correlation functions prepared in the first step, we calculate the 3D-distribution functions of water and ligands around and inside protein based on the 3D-RISM theory. The molecular recognition of a ligand by the protein is realized by the 3D-distribution functions: if one finds some conspicuous peaks in the distribution of a ligand inside protein, then the ligand is regarded as ?recognized? by the protein. Some biochemical processes are investigated, which are intimately related to the molecular recognition of small ligands including water, noble gases, and ions by a protein.},

This two-step procedure is proved to be much more efficient than direct molecular dynamics simulations combined to thermodynamic integration schemes. The approach is shown to be relevant and accurate for prototype polar solvents such as the Stockmayer solvent or acetonitrile. For water, although correct for neutral or moderately charged solute, it tends to underestimate the tetrahedral solvation structure around H-bonded solutes, such as spherical ions. This can be corrected by introducing suitable three-body correlation terms that restore both an accurate hydration structure and a satisfactory energetics.},

In the common hypernetted chain approximation to integral equations, or equivalently in the homogenous reference fluid of molecular density functional theory, coexistence is not taken into account. Hydration structures and energies of nanometer-scale hydrophobic solutes are thus incorrect. In this article, we propose a bridge functional that corrects this thermodynamic inconsistency by introducing a metastable gas phase for the homogeneous solvent. We show how this can be done by a third order expansion of the functional around the bulk liquid density that imposes the right pressure and the correct second order derivatives. Although this theory is not limited to water, we apply it to study hydrophobic solvation in water at room temperature and pressure and compare the results to all-atom simulations. The solvation free energy of small molecular solutes like n-alkanes and hard sphere solutes whose radii range from angstroms to nanometers is now in quantitative agreement with reference all atom simulations. The macroscopic liquid-gas surface tension predicted by the theory is comparable to experiments. This theory gives an alternative to the empirical hard sphere bridge correction used so far by several authors.},

	abstract = {We present a statistical field theory to describe large length scale effects induced by solutes in a cold and otherwise placid liquid. The theory divides space into a cubic grid of cells. The side length of each cell is of the order of the bulk correlation length of the bulk liquid. Large length scale states of the cells are specified with an Ising variable. Finer length scale effects are described with a Gaussian field, with mean and variance affected by both the large length scale field and by the constraints imposed by solutes. In the absence of solutes and corresponding constraints, integration over the Gaussian field yields an effective lattice-gas Hamiltonian for the large length scale field. In the presence of solutes, the integration adds additional terms to this Hamiltonian. We identify these terms analytically. They can provoke large length scale effects, such as the formation of interfaces and depletion layers. We apply our theory to compute the reversible work to form a bubble in liquid water, as a function of the bubble radius. Comparison with molecular simulation results for the same function indicates that the theory is reasonably accurate. Importantly, simulating the large length scale field involves binary arithmetic only. It thus provides a computationally convenient scheme to incorporate explicit solvent dynamics and structure in simulation studies of large molecular assemblies.},

The latter model includes a van der Waals repulsion between the oxygen (O) and hydrogen (H) atoms, which is necessary for the implementation of some integral equation theories. Two integral equation theories, the reference interaction site model (RISM) and the diagrammatically proper Chandler–Silbey–Ladanyi (CSL) theory, are tested by comparison with simulations of the MSPC model (neither theory converges for the SPC model when the hypernetted chain closure is used). The RISM theory is in reasonable agreement with simulations, and is more accurate than the CSL theory. A density functional theory (DFT) is investigated, which treats the ideal gas functional exactly and uses a truncated expansion for the excess free energy functional. The DFT is in excellent agreement with simulations for the structure of the MSPC water model at all temperatures studied, and for the structure of the SPC water model at high temperatures. At room temperature, the DFT is in good agreement with simulations (of SPC water) for gHH(r) and gOH(r), but misses the location of the second peak in gOO(r). We attribute this deficiency to the importance of three-body correlations that are not properly incorporated in the theory. © 2003 American Institute of Physics.},

The system of equations is closed by the introduction of a reference functional for the correlations beyond second order in the density difference from the equilibrium distribution. Explicit expressions are obtained for energies required to insert particles of the fluid mixture into the inhomogeneous system. The approach is illustrated by the determination of the equation of state of a simple, truncated Lennard-Jones fluid and the analysis of the behaviour of this fluid near a hard wall. The wall–fluid integral equation exhibits complete drying and the corresponding coexisting densities are in good agreement with those obtained from the standard (Maxwell) construction applied to the bulk fluid. The self-consistency of the approach is examined by analysing the virial/compressibility routes to the equation of state and the Gibbs–Duhem relation for the bulk fluid, and the contact density sum rule and the Gibbs adsorption equation for the hard-wall problem. For the bulk fluid, we find good self-consistency for stable states outside the critical region. For the hard-wall problem, the Gibbs adsorption equation is fulfilled very well near phase coexistence where the adsorption is large. For the contact density sum rule, we find deviations of up to 20\% in the ratio of the contact densities predicted by the present method and predicted by the sum rule. These deviations are largely due to a slight disagreement between the coexisting density for the gas phase obtained from the Maxwell construction and from complete drying at the hard wall.},

The solvent region is no longer modeled as a homogeneous dielectric media but rather as an assembly of self-orienting interacting dipoles of variable density. The method effectively unifies both the Poisson-centric view and the Langevin Dipole model. The model results in a variable dielectric constant ε ( r → ) in the solvent region and also in a variable solvent density ρ ( r → ) that depends on the nature of the closest exposed solute atoms. The model was calibrated using small molecules and ions solvation data with only two adjustable parameters, namely the size and dipolar moment of the solvent. Hydrophobicity scales derived from the solvent density profiles agree very well with independently derived hydrophobicity scales, both at the atomic or residue level. Dimerization interfaces in homodimeric proteins or lipid-binding regions in membrane proteins clearly appear as poorly solvated patches on the solute accessible surface. Comparison of the thermally averaged solvent density of this model with the one derived from molecular dynamics simulations shows qualitative agreement on a coarse-grained level. Because this calculation is much more rapid than that from molecular dynamics, applications of a density-profile-based solvation energy to the identification of the true structure among a set of decoys become computationally feasible. Various possible improvements of the model are discussed, as well as extensions of the formalism to treat mixtures of dipolar solvents of different sizes.},

	abstract = {This paper extends the Gaussian model of Li and Kardar [Phys. Rev. Lett. 67, 3275 (1991)]. When applied self-consistently to density fluctuations of a hard-sphere fluid, it is shown that the model gives the Percus-Yevick theory. With the addition of an attractive tail potential, the mean spherical approximation is obtained. Unlike the random-phase approximation, this appraoch determines the normal modes of the model consistent with the presence of an excluding manifold. The resulting fluid response in the presence of such an object is derived. For a D=1 manifold, the self-consistent approach is a theory of polymeric fluids. Here, with an averaging approximation, the reference-interaction-site-model (RISM) equation in the thread limit is obtained. For polymer blends, the analysis yields a seemingly exact formula for a demixing critical temperature. It scales linearly with polymer mass, as in Flory’s theory, but with an effective χ parameter smaller than that in Flory’s theory. The analysis sheds light on an erroneous prediction of different scaling made by others applying the RISM theory.},

	abstract = {A free energy model for the inhomogeneous hard‐sphere fluid mixture was derived recently [Phys. Rev. Lett. 63, 980 (1989)], which is based on the fundamental geometric measures of the particles. Along with an updated assessment of its accuracy, this model is first generalized for charged hard‐sphere fluid mixtures, in which every particle carries a central Yukawa charge, and it is then extended to general fluid mixtures in external fields. The Yukawa‐charged hard‐sphere mixture provides a quite general reference system for many interesting physical systems including plasmas, molten salts, and colloidal dispersions, the screening parameter enabling to interpolate between the long range Coulomb forces and the short range hard cores. A special renormalization property of the Yukawa potential provides the means to derive the exact Onsager‐type lower bound for the potential energy of the mixture, and its related asymptotic strong‐coupling limit of the liquid pair correlation functions. These results are obtained analytically for the general homogeneous mixture with Yukawa interactions. They enable to extend the fundamental measure free energy model to inhomogeneous charged Yukawa mixtures, with the charge contributions given by a truncated second order expansion from the uniform (bulk) fluid limit.The resulting free energy model, which interpolates between the ideal‐gas and ‘‘ideal‐liquid’’ limits, then leads to a self‐consistent method for calculating the density profiles for general fluid mixtures in external fields. This method is equivalent to an ansatz of ‘‘universality of the bridge functional.’’ The ‘‘bridge functional’’ consists of all the terms beyond the second order, in the expansion of the excess free energy functional around a reference uniform fluid. The self‐consistency is imposed by applying the general method in the special case when the external potential is generated by a ‘‘test particle’’ at the origin of coordinates. In this limit, our general method for nonuniform fluids corresponds to an established and successful theory for the bulk uniform fluid pair structure, namely the thermodynamically consistent modified‐hypernetted‐chain theory, with the bridge functions now generated by an explicit and demonstratively accurate, ‘‘universal,’’ hard‐sphere bridge functional. As a stringent test for the general model, the strongly coupled one‐component plasma, in the bulk and near a hard wall, is considered in some detail.},

Parameters for both torsional and nonbonded energetics have been derived, while the bond stretching and angle bending parameters have been adopted mostly from the AMBER all-atom force field. The torsional parameters were determined by fitting to rotational energy profiles obtained from ab initio molecular orbital calculations at the RHF/6-31G*//RHF/6-31G* level for more than 50 organic molecules and ions. The quality of the fits was high with average errors for conformational energies of less than 0.2 kcal/mol. The force-field results for molecular structures are also demonstrated to closely match the ab initio predictions. The nonbonded parameters were developed in conjunction with Monte Carlo statistical mechanics simulations by computing thermodynamic and structural properties for 34 pure organic liquids including alkanes, alkenes, alcohols, ethers, acetals, thiols, sulfides, disulfides, aldehydes, ketones, and amides. Average errors in comparison with experimental data are 2\% for heats of vaporization and densities. The Monte Carlo simulations included sampling all internal and intermolecular degrees of freedom. It is found that such non-polar and monofunctional systems do not show significant condensed-phase effects on internal energies in going from the gas phase to the pure liquids.},

In the homogeneous reference fluid approximation, the expression of the free-energy functional relies on the direct correlation function of the pure solvent. To obtain that function as exactly as possible for a given atomistic solvent model, we propose the following approach: first to perform molecular simulations of the homogeneous solvent and compute the position and angle-dependent two-body distribution functions, and then to invert the Ornstein-Zernike relation using a finite rotational invariant basis set to get the corresponding direct correlation function. This rather natural scheme is proved, for the first time to our knowledge, to be valuable for a dipolar solvent involving long range interactions. The resulting solvent free-energy functional can then be minimized on a three-dimensional grid around a solute to get the solvent particle and polarization density profiles and solvation free energies. The viability of this approach is proven in a comparison with “exact” molecular dynamics calculations for the simple test case of spherical ions in a dipolar solvent.},

Within QSDFT, solid atoms are considered as quenched component(s) of the solid?fluid system with given density distribution(s). Solid?fluid intermolecular interactions are split into hard-sphere repulsive and mean-field attractive parts. The former are treated with the multicomponent fundamental measure density functional. Capabilities of QSDFT are demonstrated by drawing on the example of adsorption on amorphous silica materials. We show that, using established intermolecular potentials and a realistic model for silica surfaces, QSDFT quantitatively describes adsorption/desorption isotherms of Ar and Kr on reference MCM-41, SBA-15, and LiChrosphere materials in a wide range of relative pressures. QSDFT offers a systematic approach to the practical problems of characterization of microporous, mesoporous, and amorphous silica materials, including an assessment of microporosity, surface roughness, and adsorption deformation. Predictions for the pore diameter and the extent of pore surface roughness in MCM-41 and SBA-15 materials are in very good agreement with recent X-ray diffraction studies.},

D. Chandler et al., Mol. Phys. 46, 1335 (1982)
]. The resulting functions are then used to diagrammatically renormalize the molecular fluid theory. A result is that the diagrammatically proper interaction site model theory is shown to be a linearized, minimal angular basis set approximation to this site-renormalized molecular theory. This framework is used to propose a new, exact, and proper closure to the diagrammatically proper interaction site model theory. The resulting equation system contains a bridge function expansion in the proper site-site theory. In addition, the construction of the theory is such that the molecular pair distribution function, in full dimensionality, is intrinsic to the theory. Furthermore, the theory is equivalent to the molecular Ornstein-Zernike treatment of site-site molecules in the basis set expansion of 
Blum and Torruella [J. Chem. Phys. 56, 303 (1971)]
. A significant formal result of the theory is the demonstration that certain classes of diagrams which would otherwise be considered improper in the interaction site model formalism are included in the angular expansion of molecular interactions. Numerical results for several apolar homonuclear models and an apolar heteronuclear model are shown to quantitatively improve upon those of reference interaction site model and our recent proper variant with respect to simulation. Significant numerical results are that the various thermodynamic quantities obey the exact symmetries and sum rules within numerical error for the different sites in the heteronuclear case, even for the low order approximation used in this work, and the theory is independent of the so-called auxiliary site problem common to previous site-site theories.},

The excess Helmholtz energy functional is formulated in terms of a quadratic expansion with respect to the local density deviation from that of a uniform system and a universal functional for all higher-order terms approximated by that of a reference hard-sphere system. With the atomistic pair direct correlation functions of the uniform system calculated from MD simulation and an analytical expression for the bridge functional from the modified fundamental measure theory, the SDFT can be used to predict the structure and thermodynamic properties of water under inhomogeneous conditions with a computational cost negligible in comparison to that of brute-force simulations. The numerical performance of the SDFT has been demonstrated with the predictions of the solvation free energies of 15 molecular analogs of amino acid side chains in water represented by SPC/E, SPC, and TIP3P models. For theTIP3P model, a comparison of the theoretical predictions with MD simulation and experimental data shows agreement within 0.64 and 1.09 kcal/mol on average, respectively.},

	abstract = {A generalization of the RISM integral equation for site–site pair correlation functions previously proposed by us is discussed and applied to model liquids composed of strongly polar diatomic molecules. The nonuniform molecular charge distribution is represented by the introduction of charged interaction sites. The generalization consists of applying closure conditions analogous to those which are known to be reasonable for the description of atomic ionic fluids, and the corresponding renormalization of the contributions arising from long range forces. We discuss both the symmetry properties of the pair correlation functions in special cases and the dielectric properties implied by theory. Applications are presented for three two‐site models which differ substantially in the degree of asymmetry of the non‐Coulombic potential between the two sites, and for three three‐site models for Br2. The two sites models are compared to computer simulation results, and those for Br2 to experimental results. The analysis shows that the integral equation is well balanced in that in every case the qualitative features of the liquids structure which are introduced by polarity are well represented, even in cases where the site–site potentials are individually much larger than kBT. In cases where the molecular shape and polar forces are in competition, the results are of comparable accuracy to the corresponding theory for nonpolar systems. In the extreme case where changes in orientational structure can occur without interfering with packing requirements, the results appear quantitatively less reliable.},

Both solute?solvent electrostatic and van der Waals interactions are fully included, and solvent packing is taken into account. The approach is illustrated by calculating the average oxygen and hydrogen density of liquid water around two molecular solutes:? water and N-methylacetamide. Molecular dynamics simulations are performed to test the results obtained from the integral equation. It is observed that important microscopic structural features of the average water density due to hydrogen bonding are reproduced by the integral equation. The integral equation has a simple formal structure and is easy to implement numerically. It offers a powerful alternative to computer simulations with explicit solvent molecules and to continuum solvent representations for incorporating solvation effects in a wide range of applications.},

The quality of the results obtained within the HNC approximation is discussed by comparison with values from molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The MOZ-HNC theory yields internal excess energies and dielectric constants which are about 20\% smaller than the simulation results found in the literature. The relative trends of the properties observed by simulation for the different interaction models are correctly predicted. In order to calculate the rotational invariant coefficients which define the liquid structure, new MD simulations were carried out. The rotational invariant coefficients derived from the simulation and from the MOZ theory strongly differ. In particular, the center–center distribution functions show that the theory is not able to reproduce the tetrahedral structure of water. In this solvent a comparison of the O–H distribution function indicates that the MOZ theory underestimates the H bonding. The use of a spherically symmetric bridge function in the reference HNC approximation does not lead to an improvement of the MOZ results. The observed defects of the MOZ-HNC approach contrast with the good agreement found for aprotic solvents and are presumably due to the association by H bonds in water and methanol. © 1999 American Institute of Physics.},
